## Rationale
Disabling secure transfer allows plain HTTP; this risks data in transit.

## Detection
Detect `azurerm_storage_account` with `enable_https_traffic_only = false` or missing.

## Remediation
Set `enable_https_traffic_only = true` for all storage accounts.

## KPI
- **Metric:** incidents_count  
- **Estimated savings:** Lower risk

- **Will:** Assign owner, sprint, and deadline.  
- **SMARTer:** Track `incidents_count` over a sprint.
